    # Authentication

    Each API request that is sent to BlueJeans requires an access token, which is obtained through the BlueJeans Authentication API. There are several methods (grant types) for obtaining an access token, which follow the OAuth2.0 specification.

    ## Grant Types

    * Authorization Code Grant – This grant type is used in an authentication flow commonly referred to as "three-legged OAuth". The user authenticates via a BlueJeans page, which provides an authorization code. This code, along with a few other elements, can be used to obtain an access code.

    * Password Credentials Grant – This grant type is used in a two-legged OAuth flow. Username and password are sent to retrieve an access code.

    * Client Credentials Grant – This grant type is used in a two-legged OAuth flow.


    ## Access & Permissions

    The access level that is associated with each access token is referred to as the scope. There are three basic levels of access that BlueJeans allows, which affect the level of scope.


    Three access levels exist within the Blue Jeans service today.

    * Meeting-level – Authentication takes place using a meeting ID and passcode, and the scope is limited to APIs that relate to the individual meeting.

    * User-level – Authentication either takes place via three-legged OAuth, or else a direct authorization token request containing a username or password. Access level depends on the requested scope permissions.

    * App-level – An application is provisioned either by BlueJeans personnel, or within the BlueJeans Enterprise Admin interface. When provisioning an app, a client key and secret are provided, which is then used to obtain an access token, via the BlueJeans Authentication API. The scope that is associated with the token will provide access to an entire enterprise and all of its users.


    All endpoints in this document that require Enterprise Admin access will be marked as such.

    ## Testing

    In order to make effective use of this page, you will first use one of the authentication methods to obtain an access token. Once the token is given, use the Authenticate button up in the header to store the token. Each BlueJeans API called after that will use the access token provided.

If a Moderator passcode is sent, moderator privileges are granted. If an Attendee access code is passed, the access token will have a limited scope of access that an attendee has within a meeting.
