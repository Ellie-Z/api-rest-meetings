    \ communication._\n# Authentication\nEach API request that is sent to BlueJeans\
    \ requires an access token, which is obtained through the BlueJeans Authentication\
    \ API. There are several methods (grant types) for obtaining an access token,\
    \ which follow the OAuth2.0 specification.\n## Grant Types\n* Authorization Code\
    \ Grant – This grant type is used in an authentication flow commonly referred\
    \ to as \"three-legged OAuth\". The user authenticates via a BlueJeans page, which\
    \ provides an authorization code. This code, along with a few other elements,\
    \ can be used to obtain an access code.\n* Password Credentials Grant – This grant\
    \ type is used in a two-legged OAuth flow. Username and password are sent to retrieve\
    \ an access code.\n* Client Credentials Grant – This grant type is used in a two-legged\
    \ OAuth flow.\n\n## Access & Permissions\nThe access level that is associated\
    \ with each access token is referred to as the scope. There are three basic levels\
    \ of access that BlueJeans allows, which affect the level of scope.\n\nThree access\
    \ levels exist within the Blue Jeans service today.\n* Meeting-level – Authentication\
    \ takes place using a meeting ID and passcode, and the scope is limited to APIs\
    \ that relate to the individual meeting.\n* User-level – Authentication either\
    \ takes place via three-legged OAuth, or else a direct authorization token request\
    \ containing a username or password. Access level depends on the requested scope\
    \ permissions.\n* App-level – An application is provisioned either by BlueJeans\
    \ personnel, or within the BlueJeans Enterprise Admin interface. When provisioning\
    \ an app, a client key and secret are provided, which is then used to obtain an\
    \ access token, via the BlueJeans Authentication API. The scope that is associated\
    \ with the token will provide access to an entire enterprise and all of its users.\n\
    \nAll endpoints in this document that require Enterprise Admin access will be\
    \ marked as such.\n## Testing\nIn order to make effective use of this page, you\
    \ will first use one of the authentication methods to obtain an access token.\
    \ Once the token is given, use the Authenticate button up in the header to store\
    \ the token. Each BlueJeans API called after that will use the access token provided.\n"
